                    or any other online or mobile payment services provider we may use (including through any app

                    amount of the transaction payment. This payment information is stored by our payment processors and
                    associated with a merchant name/ID and location which our payment processor gives to us, together
                    with a unique customer ID which we share with them but this payment information is never stored or
                    processed by us. Our payment processors use this payment information to process and facilitate the
                    payment of your subscription fee in order that we may provide you with the service you have
                    requested or to enter into a contract with you to access the Platform (in other words to perform the
                    contract). So that we know you have paid your subscription fee our payment processors will send us a
                    unique transaction ID which we associate with your unique customer ID and which we keep for internal
                    accounting purposes because we have a legal obligation to do so</p>

                <p style="color:rgb(132, 132, 128);">Our payment processors may use third party fraud detection software
                    or providers which analyse your
                    payment information in order to make automated decisions as to whether or not payment from you will
                    be accepted. You have the right to contest any fraud decision made about you and to be given more

                    receive invoice receipts from third parties for your subscription purchase and these receipts are
                    stored by us as we have a legitimate business interest to keep them for internal accounting and tax
                    purposes and to comply with our legal obligation as per any applicable laws including any audits,
                    legal proceedings and/or investigations.</p>
